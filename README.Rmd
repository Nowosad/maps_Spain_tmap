```

This repo shows two approaches to create an inset map of Spain, which shows the Canary Islands and ensures that relative sizes are preserved.

## Code

[The first approach](https://github.com/Nowosad/spain-map-layout/blob/master/R/01_first_approach.R) uses a ratio between the Spain continental territory and Canary Island to plot both on a map.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height=400}
knitr::include_graphics("maps/01_map.png", dpi = NA)
```

[The second approach](https://github.com/Nowosad/spain-map-layout/blob/master/R/02_second_approach.R) moves geometries representing Canary Island closer to the Spain continental territory.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height=400}
knitr::include_graphics("maps/02_map.png", dpi = NA)
```

## Data

Spatial data allowing for alternative visualizations of Spain using the second approach is available in:

- [GeoPackage format](https://github.com/Nowosad/spain-map-layout/raw/master/data/spain_data.gpkg)
- [ESRI Shapefile format](https://github.com/Nowosad/spain-map-layout/raw/master/data/spain_data.zip)
- [RDS format](https://github.com/Nowosad/spain-map-layout/raw/master/data/spain_data.rds)

Created maps were inspired by https://github.com/aaumaitre/maps_Spain and https://github.com/aaumaitre/maps_Spain/issues/1#issue-513198322.
